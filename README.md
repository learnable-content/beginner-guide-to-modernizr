# A beginners guide to Modernizr

Modernizr is a feature detection JavaScript library that works by running tests to see what CSS, HTML and JavaScript features the current browser supports. It then gives you CSS classes and a JavaScript API so you can progressively enhance (PE) around what the current browser is capable of. This course will take you through getting up to speed with Modernizr; creating custom builds, utilising the CSS class and taking advantage of Modernizr in your JavaScript.
