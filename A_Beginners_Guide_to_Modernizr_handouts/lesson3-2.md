# Features

A good question is, how can I know what the name of the features I select in the builder is going to be in the JavaScript Modernizr global. A good rule of thumb is it's usually all lowercase with no spaces in the feature name.

For example, for flexbox it's `Modernizer.flexbox`. A good reference to see all the feature tech names and what your current browser support is a Modernizr test width page. This page will display all of them in green when supported and red when not.

# Dev tools

Another way is using the browser dev tools. Browser's console will automatically suggest you some options when you start typing, for example by issuing `Modernizer.fl` you'll see all the property names that start with "fl".
