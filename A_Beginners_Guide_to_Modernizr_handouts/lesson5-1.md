# Course Summary

Congratulations! You've made it through the beginners guide to Modernizr!

We've covered a lot of ground and I'd highly recommend you check out the resources section on modernizr.com that we covered in the intro. There's a lot of good information there and it can help you to extend your skills further. Don't forget to ask questions in the course if you need more clarification for something that doesn't make sense.

Thanks for watching and happy coding!
