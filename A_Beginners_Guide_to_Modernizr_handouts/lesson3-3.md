# Modernizr API.

Beyond having access to the feature detection results, Modernizr also has a few methods that can help you inside your JavaScript. We'll cover the two most useful APIs and a simple example of how can you use them.

`Modernizr.mq()` is a function to help you with the media queries.

`Modernizer.prefixed()` and `Modernizer.prefixedCSS()` both return the prefixed version of what we passed in if the current browser recognized it.
