# What is Progressive Enhancement?

We've talked about feature detection, and we have covered a lot of the Modernizr feature set. Let's discover how Modernizr and **progressive enhancement** play well together.

You may have heard the term progressive enhancement and wonder what it is. Essentially it's a strategy, or principle, of creating a functional website with a widely supported array of features, and then building up to more complexity based on what the user's browser is capable of. To take a quote, "progressive Enhancement is the principle of starting with a rock-solid foundation and then adding enhancements to it if you know certain visiting user-agents can handle the improved experience". If we write our CSS to cater for the simplest present first, and then target with supported classes to enhance the user experience for your website, we can leverage the varied principle of progressive enhancement.
